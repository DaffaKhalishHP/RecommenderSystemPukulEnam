# RecommenderSystemPukulEnam

## Project Description

Team formation for projects often requires significant time and effort from project managers. Various factors such as interpersonal relationships, individual capabilities, and current availability of team members need to be considered. PukulEnam, an AI consulting services company, also faces these challenges in their project management process. The team formation process involves checking individual availability, reviewing past project experiences, and ensuring a good fit for the client's needs.

PukulEnam offers a range of consulting services, including digital transformation, data transformation, and artificial intelligence technology development. As a result, the company has a diverse pool of talent with skills in website development (back-end and front-end), cloud engineering, technical writing, data science, and data analytics. Currently, there are 12 talented individuals in the company.

Due to the diversity of skills and varying availability of team members, team formation takes a significant amount of time and energy. To address this problem, our team has developed a Recommender System using machine learning. This system automates the team formation process and provides a compatibility percentage for each team member based on their current availability and the client's needed skill.


## Objective 

The objectives of this project are :

1. Automated Team Formation: The recommender system automates the team formation process by analyzing past projects, individual skill sets, and availability. It eliminates the need for manual selection and reduces the time and effort required by project managers.
2. Fit Assessment: The system provides an estimate of how well each individual fits the client's needs based on their skill sets in percentages. This assessment helps project managers identify the most suitable team members for a the given project.
3. Real-Time Availability Updates: The availability of each individual is continuously updated in the system. When a project is taken or completed, project managers can easily access the updated availability status and contact the relevant team members accordingly.

## Data 
PukulEnam provides real past projects data, however after consideration our team decided to make a dummy data consist of 50.000 rows of past project data to train the model.
The data consist of 4 Columns
