## Project Description

Team formation for projects often requires significant time and effort from project managers. Various factors such as interpersonal relationships, individual capabilities, and current availability of team members need to be considered. PukulEnam, an AI consulting services company, also faces these challenges in their project management process. The team formation process involves checking individual availability, reviewing past project experiences, and ensuring a good fit for the client's needs.

PukulEnam offers a range of consulting services, including digital transformation, data transformation, and artificial intelligence technology development. As a result, the company has a diverse pool of talent with skills in website development (back-end and front-end), cloud engineering, technical writing, data science, and data analytics. Currently, there are 12 talented individuals in the company.

Due to the diversity of skills and varying availability of team members, team formation takes a significant amount of time and energy. To address this problem, our team has developed a Recommender System using machine learning. This system automates the team formation process and provides a compatibility percentage for each team member based on their current availability and the client's needed skill.


## Objective

The Team Formation Recommender System aims to automate the team formation process by considering factors such as past projects, individual skill sets, and availability. It offers the following functionalities:

1. Automated Team Formation: The system streamlines the team formation process by leveraging information from past projects, individual skill sets, and availability. This automation reduces the burden on project managers and saves time and effort.
2. Fit Estimation: The recommender system provides an estimate of how well each individual aligns with the client's requirements based on their skill sets. This assessment assists project managers in identifying the most suitable team members for a specific project.
3. Real-Time Availability Updates: The system enables project managers to easily update the availability status of each individual. As projects are taken or completed, the availability information can be promptly modified, facilitating efficient communication and coordination.
